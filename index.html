            <p class="meal-prep">For Day 1 breakfast, start by gathering yogurt, granola, strawberries, banana, apple,
                and honey. Wash the
                strawberries, slice them, and do the same for the banana and apple. In a bowl, add a serving of yogurt
                and top it with granola. Then, arrange the sliced fruits on top and drizzle some honey for added
                sweetness. Serve immediately and enjoy this refreshing and nutritious breakfast!</p>
            <p class="meal-prep">For lunch, prepare grilled chicken breast with mashed potatoes and a spinach salad.
                Season the chicken
                breast with olive oil, salt, and pepper, then grill it on medium-high heat for about 6-7 minutes on each
                side until fully cooked. Meanwhile, peel and dice potatoes, boil them in salted water until tender, then
                mash them with milk and butter until smooth. For the spinach salad, wash the spinach, tear it into
                bite-sized pieces, and combine it with sliced tomato, drizzled with olive oil and seasoned with salt and
                pepper. Plate the grilled chicken alongside the creamy mashed potatoes and fresh salad for a satisfying
                meal. </p>
            <p class="meal-prep">For dinner, create a hearty vegetable soup using carrots, potatoes, zucchini, vegetable
                broth, onion, and
                garlic. Begin by peeling and dicing the carrots and potatoes, then chopping the zucchini and mincing the
                onion and garlic. In a large pot, heat olive oil and sauté the onion and garlic until translucent. Add
                the diced carrots and potatoes, cooking for about 5 minutes before pouring in the vegetable broth. Bring
                it to a boil, add the zucchini, and simmer until all the vegetables are tender. Season with salt and
                pepper to taste, and serve the hot soup with slices of whole-grain bread on the side for a comforting
                end to the day.</p>

            <h3 class="meal-title">MEAL PREPARATION FOR DAY 2</h3>
            <p class="meal-prep">For Day 2 breakfast, begin by gathering your ingredients, which include bread, a ripe
                avocado, an egg,
                salt, pepper, and olive oil (optional). Start by toasting a slice of bread until it’s golden brown.
                While the bread is toasting, cut the avocado in half, remove the pit, and scoop the flesh into a bowl.
                Mash the avocado with a fork, seasoning it with salt and pepper. To poach the egg, bring a small pot of
                water to a gentle simmer, adding a splash of vinegar if desired. Crack the egg into a small bowl and
                gently slide it into the water, cooking for about 3-4 minutes until the white is set but the yolk
                remains runny. Once the bread is toasted, spread the mashed avocado on top, place the poached egg, and
                season with additional salt and pepper. Serve immediately with a cup of tea on the side.</p>
            <p class="meal-prep">For lunch, prepare spaghetti Bolognese by gathering your ingredients: spaghetti, ground
                beef, onion,
                garlic, tomato sauce, olive oil, salt, and pepper. Start by boiling water in a large pot and cooking the
                spaghetti according to the package instructions until al dente. In a large skillet, heat olive oil over
                medium heat, adding diced onion and minced garlic until softened. Then, add the ground beef and cook
                until browned, draining any excess fat if necessary. Stir in the tomato sauce, season with salt and
                pepper, and let it simmer for about 15-20 minutes. Once the spaghetti is cooked and drained, toss it
                with the Bolognese sauce until well coated, and serve hot, optionally garnished with grated cheese and
                fresh basil.</p>
            <p class="meal-prep">For dinner, make a spinach and cheese omelette served with cucumber slices. Gather your
                ingredients:
                eggs, fresh spinach, cheese, cucumber, olive oil or butter, salt, and pepper. Start by washing and
                roughly chopping the spinach and slicing the cucumber. In a bowl, whisk the eggs with salt and pepper.
                Heat olive oil or butter in a non-stick skillet over medium heat, adding the spinach and sautéing until
                wilted. Pour the whisked eggs over the spinach and cook until the edges begin to set. Sprinkle cheese on
                top, fold the omelette in half, and continue cooking until the cheese melts and the eggs are fully
                cooked. Serve the omelette hot alongside the refreshing cucumber slices for a light and satisfying
                dinner. </p>

                an apple, cinnamon,
                and optional sugar. In a pot, combine the rolled oats and water or milk in a 1:2 ratio (1 cup oats to 2
                cups liquid). Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and simmer for about 5-10
                minutes, stirring occasionally until it thickens. While the oatmeal is cooking, wash the apple and slice
                it into thin rounds or wedges, sprinkling them with cinnamon and a bit of sugar if desired. Once the
                oatmeal is ready, pour it into a bowl and top it with the cinnamon-sprinkled apple slices for a warm and
                hearty breakfast.</p>
            <p class="meal-prep">For lunch, prepare baked fish served with rice and steamed broccoli. Gather your
                ingredients, including
                fish fillets (such as salmon or tilapia), rice, broccoli, olive oil, lemon, salt, and pepper. Preheat
                the oven to 375°F (190°C) and place the fish fillets on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.
                Drizzle with olive oil, season with salt, pepper, and a squeeze of lemon juice, then bake for about
                15-20 minutes or until the fish flakes easily with a fork. Rinse the rice under cold water, then combine
                it with water in a pot according to the package instructions. While the rice cooks, bring a small pot of
                water to a boil and steam the broccoli for about 5-7 minutes until tender. Plate the baked fish
                alongside the cooked rice and steamed broccoli for a nutritious and balanced lunch.</p>
            <p class="meal-prep">For dinner, make a turkey breast sandwich with lettuce, tomato, and cheese on
                whole-grain bread. Gather
                sliced turkey breast, lettuce, tomato, cheese, whole-grain bread, and optional mayonnaise or mustard.
                Start by washing and drying the lettuce leaves, then slice the tomato. Take two slices of whole-grain
                bread and spread mayonnaise or mustard on one side if desired. Layer with slices of turkey breast,
                followed by lettuce and tomato, then add cheese on top before closing the sandwich with the other slice
                of bread. Cut the sandwich in half and serve it with your favorite side, such as chips or a small salad,
                for a satisfying end to the day.</p>

                grilled chicken, and croutons, then drizzle with Caesar dressing and toss to combine. Plate the salad
                and sprinkle with Parmesan cheese and black pepper, if desired, for a satisfying lunch.</p>
            <p class="meal-prep">For dinner, make a cream of pumpkin soup with sunflower seeds and bread. Gather your
                ingredients: pumpkin
                (fresh or canned), onion, garlic, vegetable broth, olive oil, sunflower seeds, whole-grain bread, salt,
                and pepper. If using fresh pumpkin, peel, seed, and chop it into cubes. In a large pot, heat olive oil
                over medium heat and add chopped onion and minced garlic, sautéing until soft. Add the pumpkin cubes (or
                canned pumpkin) and vegetable broth, bringing the mixture to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until the
                pumpkin is tender (about 15-20 minutes). Using an immersion blender or a regular blender, puree the soup
                until smooth and season with salt and pepper to taste. Ladle the soup into bowls, garnish with sunflower
                seeds, and serve hot with slices of whole-grain bread for a comforting dinner.</p>

            <p class="meal-prep">For Day 5 breakfast, begin by gathering your ingredients: whole wheat pancake mix,
                ripe
                bananas, honey,
                and optional toppings such as syrup or fresh fruit. Prepare the pancake batter according to the
                package
                instructions, adding mashed bananas to the mix for added flavor and nutrition. Heat a non-stick
                skillet
                over medium heat and pour in the batter, cooking until bubbles form on the surface. Flip the
                pancakes
                and cook until golden brown. Once ready, serve the pancakes stacked high, topped with additional
                banana
                slices and a drizzle of honey for a delicious start to your day.</p>
            <p class="meal-prep">For lunch, prepare a dish of stewed lentils served with rice and avocado salad.
                Gather
                your ingredients:
                dried lentils, rice, onion, garlic, bell pepper, olive oil, spices (like cumin and paprika), and
                fresh
                avocado. Rinse the lentils under cold water and set aside. In a pot, heat olive oil over medium heat
                and
                sauté chopped onion, garlic, and bell pepper until softened. Add the rinsed lentils, water, and
                spices,
                bringing the mixture to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for about 25-30 minutes until the lentils are
                tender. While the lentils cook, prepare the rice according to the package instructions. For the
                avocado
                salad, dice the avocado and mix it with lime juice, salt, and diced tomatoes. Serve the stewed
                lentils
                alongside the rice and avocado salad for a hearty and nutritious lunch.</p>
            <p class="meal-prep">For dinner, make a tuna salad with lettuce, grated carrot, and sweet corn. Gather

                ingredients:

                bowl,
                drain the canned tuna and flake it with a fork. In another bowl, combine the tuna, grated carrot,
                and
                sweet corn, then add mayonnaise and a squeeze of lemon juice to taste. Season with salt and pepper,
                mixing until well combined. Serve the tuna salad over a bed of fresh lettuce for a light and
                satisfying
                dinner.</p>

                Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Season the beef with salt and pepper, then place it in a baking dish.
                Bake for about 25-30 minutes or until cooked to your desired doneness. While the beef is baking, peel
                and chop the potatoes, then steam them until tender. For the coleslaw, thinly slice the cabbage and

                minutes per side, or until cooked through. While the chicken is grilling, peel and chop the sweet
                potatoes, then boil them until tender. Drain and mash the sweet potatoes, adding a touch of olive oil,
                salt, and pepper to taste. For the asparagus, toss it in olive oil, salt, and pepper, then grill for
                about 5 minutes until tender. Plate the grilled chicken alongside the asparagus and sweet potato mash
                for a balanced and satisfying lunch.</p>
